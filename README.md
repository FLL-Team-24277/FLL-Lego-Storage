## Colored Bins for Building

We have different types of storage that we use for building robots. This github repository will document the overall storage plan. If it helps your team, drop us a not to let us know!

![These are the bins each of our team members use to build their robots](https://github.com/FLL-Team-24277/FLL-Lego-Storage/blob/main/Massca%20Hardware%20Organizer.jpg)

We have eleven bins, each with a different color. In some cases, pieces aren't available in certain colors, so we substitute those pieces with gray ones. Here's what a bin looks like when it is filled. The team member can take this bin to their desk while they are building.

As you can see, each bin has all of the beam sizes 3-15, plus the 3x5 and 2x4 liftarms. We also have some 5x7 frames, regular black pegs and long blue pegs. Most of the time these are enough colored parts for each member to complete the season, but sometimes they need more. Should a team member need more colored beams, we have spares stored in a fifteen-bin rack like this:

We put extra colored beams in the different bins here, just in case someone needs them.

Next, we have the bins that we use for storing all of the assorted pieces we need to build our robots. Normally these stay on the storage rack, or on a desk that is exclusively for looking through bins. We have sixteen different bins, each storing a different type of piece

All of the other bins are basically the same. Just look at the pdf to see what all we have in them.
